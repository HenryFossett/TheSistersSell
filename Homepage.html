            <div class="quote"><h3>"My knowledge can save you time, money, and stress"</h3></div>
            Years of owning and managing rentals, of buying and selling Cincinnati properties has given me a strong foundation of knowledge in real estate. My knowledge can save you time, money, and stress. In addition to sharing design ideas and neighborhood information, I can help spot potential inspection items that may allow buyers to negotiate a better price or sellers to avoid problems. My experience in renovation and management has provided me with resources for information and repairs, too. If your home needs work, chances are that I can recommend the right person for the job. Questions? We’ll get the answers. I’m a Cincinnati native with a global view of the world. This means I have essential knowledge about local neighborhoods, schools, amenities and events, but I embrace different cultures, backgrounds and perspectives. I am comfortable on a building site and at the negotiating table, renovating and decorating, buying and selling. Let me provide you with a great experience.

            I am a people person. I love to find out what makes them tick, what makes them happy. Moving brings up a lot of emotion that many realtors don’t want to address. That is not the case here– consider me your real estate therapist. I will do what I can to make your time with us as stress-free as possible. My love of technology will benefit you, as well. This is not your parents’ real estate experience. You need a realtor who is competent to bring you information quickly and to market your home efficiently using today’s tools. Do you want a website made for your listing? I have that proficiency, and I will use it to save you money and time. As a Cincinnati Native, I have an inherent understanding of the city.  Let me help you find the house and neighborhood that meets your needs and provides the lifestyle you desire. Whether you are looking for urban walkability, the right school district for your kids or a quiet place in the country, I’ll make sure you find it.
